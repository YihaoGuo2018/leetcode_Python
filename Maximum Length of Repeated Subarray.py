class Solution(object):
    def findLength(self, A, B):
        memo = [[0] * (len(B) + 1) for _ in range(len(A) + 1)]
        for i in range(len(A) - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(len(B) - 1, -1, -1):
                if A[i] == B[j]:
                    memo[i][j] = memo[i+1][j+1]+1
        return max(max(row) for row in memo)
#     Since a common subarray of A and B must start at some A[i] and B[j], let dp[i][j] be the longest common prefix of A[i:] and B[j:]. Whenever A[i] == B[j], we know dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1] + 1. Also, the answer is max(dp[i][j]) over all i, j.

# We can perform bottom-up dynamic programming to find the answer based on this recurrence. Our loop invariant is that the answer is already calculated correctly and stored in dp for any larger i, j.
